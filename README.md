# MonorepoDemo

This project is meant to act as a reference for an Angular monorepo project consisting of multiple apps and libraries. Libraries can either be monolithic or consisting of sub-packages. This is for Angular v21, which uses vitest as its unit test framework. Integrating vitest with Angular & VSCode (editor of choice), requires a bit of tweaking to the default config generated by the `ng` CLI, which is what this project and the accompanying README (this file) tries to capture.

## Steps

1. Generate the angular workspace with `--no-create-application` command line paramter.

```
$ ng new monorepo-demo --no-create-application
```

2. Install additional packages. These are:

```
$ npm i @analogjs/platform @analogjs/vite-plugin-angular @analogjs/vitest-angular jsdom vite-tsconfig-paths --save-dev
```

3. Generate the app:

```
$ ng g app helloworld --project-root=apps/helloworld
```

Note how we specify the project's root folder in the command line. The folder structure we employ categorizes apps and libraries under separate parent folders named `apps` and `libs` respectively.

4. Generate a library:

```
$ ng g library shared --project-root=libs/shared
```

Issue `ng build shared` and `ng test shared`. Both commands should not produce any errors.

5. Import the default `<lib-shared>` component into the app and add it to the app template. It should be reflected in the app UI.
